Since long time, I was thinking to jot done my journey of learning new topics in area of Computer Science and Software Engineering. This is a reboot to my hobby of writing.  



## Why did I Stop earlier

It was the time when I was accepted for Master Program and I had quit my previous job. Just for getting my visa acceptance, I had to be itinerant. It was tiresome days. During those days, I was away from programming, reading, and writing. The habit of writing blog were gone. Once you loose the habit, it is really difficult to regain it.

## Why did I start

Currently, I am studing Master Program in Applied Computer Science. Each term, I am studing different technology ranging from Algorithm to Distributed System Design, Software measurement to Advance programming, from problem solving to AI.

So I have though of noting down the stuff I study and how it is expanding my horizon in understanding the core and electives stuffs of Computer Science.

Another motivation is to showcase my side project (yah yah, Github is right place for this, even though)
and learning process about technologies used during implementation and execution of such project.

The End...
